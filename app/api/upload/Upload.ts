    //     - Begin the blog with a relatable, personal anecdote or story that ties into the topic.
    //     - Maintain a conversational flow, making the reader feel as if they're being spoken to directly.
    //     - Use humor, informal language, and personal insights where appropriate.
    //     - Encourage reflection by posing questions to the reader and addressing them directly (e.g., "What does this mean for you?").
    //     - Balance the casual tone with useful, actionable advice.
    //     - Human Written
    //     - 100% Unique
    //     - SEO Optimized
    //     - Plagiarism Free
    //     - Relevant to the title

    //     The structure of the blog should be strictly organized as follows:

    //     1. **Author and Quote:**
    //        - Generate a random author's name.
    //        - Include a relevant quote from the author that reflects the theme of the blog and sets the tone.

    //     2. **Page Title:**
    //        - The main title of the blog post.

    //     3. **Image Query:**
    //        - Generate a query for the main image that aligns with the blog content.

    //     4. **Blog Content:**
    //        - For each section, generate an object with the following fields:
    //          - **Description:** This field should provide detailed content about the section. The description should not include the title or any image query.
    //          - **Query:** This field should contain an image query related to the section content, or set to null if no image is required.

    //     5. **SEO Information:**

    //        - **metaDescription:** A brief summary of the blogâ€™s content to be used as the meta description tag.
    //        - **ogTitle:** The Open Graph title, used for sharing the blog on social media.
    //        - **ogDescription:** The Open Graph description, summarizing the content for social sharing.
    //        - **Primary Keywords:** The most important keywords or phrases relevant to the blogâ€™s topic.
    //        - **Secondary Keywords:** Related or supporting keywords to assist with search engine rankings.

    //     The response should be formatted as an object with two main fields:

    //     - **seo:** An object containing all the SEO-related fields.
    //     - **content:** An array of objects where each object includes the title, description, and query for each section.

    //     Ensure that descriptions, and image queries are not mixed or included in the wrong fields. Each field should be strictly adhered to as described above, and the blog should flow logically from section to section. Provide substantial, fact-based information, avoid placeholders or filler, and maintain an engaging, conversational tone throughout.
